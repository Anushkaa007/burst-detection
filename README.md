Burst Detection Script

This script detects bursts in neural spike train data using inter-spike intervals (ISI).
It processes data from an HDF5 file and generates plots for each electrode.

Dependencies:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- h5py
- scipy
- more_itertools

Usage:
Run the script in a Python environment with the required libraries installed.

Plot Script
This Python script is designed to analyze and visualize neural spike train data recorded from electrodes. It begins by loading raw recording data from a specified file, allowing users to extract specific segments of the signal for closer examination. The script then generates clear and informative time series plots for selected channels, highlighting important time intervals and adding annotations to indicate significant events, such as voltage levels or light exposure. By organizing the code into functions, it ensures that the script is easy to read and maintain, making it accessible for researchers and developers interested in studying neural activity.
